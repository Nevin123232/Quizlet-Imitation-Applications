In this repository, there are applications that I created in order to mimic quizlet's functionalities. 

Quizlet Version 1:
- I created Quizlet version 1 in Visual basic, it was a part of a pokemon name translator I was working on. I attempted to create a user interface for a quizlet-like application. 

Quizlet Version 2:
- In quizlet version 2 (a text-based java application), I created a way to save the cards the user created and there is a study and test mode for the user to test their comprehension and memorization of their flashcards. 

Quizlet Version 3:
- In quizlet version 3, I attempted to combine the two (a user interface and logic for filing flashcards) in visual basic. This resulted in the prototype Quizlet version 3. 

Pokemon name Translator:
- I also created a Pokemon name translator. The names of 50 pokemon are translated from (french to english) and (english to french). 

These are all of the applications found in this repository.
